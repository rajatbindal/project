<span style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:20px;"><font color="black">Supporting nature and thus helping the life on Earth can be done by following different-different easy tasks like -</font></span><br>

<span style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:20px;"><font color="black">1)Avoid use of Plastics as much as you can, abandon disposable &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plastics, straws, Foams and don't use plastic bags while shopping, &nbsp&nbsp&nbspinstead use a cotton or Paper bag.
<br><br>2) Restrict uses of Glass materials and re-cycle them.
<br><br>3) Recycle paper, thousands of trees are cut to produce paper.
<br><br>4) Use renewable energy sources like Solar energy, thus reducing &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe use of thermal and nuclear energy for your daily needs.
<br><br>5) Use public transport, despite of travelling in your own vehicles.
<br><br>6) Use electric vehicles instead of fuel and CNG powered ones.
<br><br>7) Plant trees, take care of them. You can plant anywhere, on your &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspterrace, lawn, Garden etc.
Become Vegeterian, consume vegs &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspinstead of Non-veg sources.</font></span><br><br>

<span style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:20px;"><font color="black">It is now known soil contains over 3 times the carbon of all vegetation combined. There is even a 2017 peer-reviewed paper that says the carbon in the top 2 meters of soil is 3,000 gigatonnes, or almost 5x the amount in vegetation.

<span style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:20px;"><font color="black">Yes, everything will be different.<br>

Because of our excess CO2, we will have become a type 1 civilization. The scope of man made climate change Mandates that we become strong enough to fix it. We will be generating MORE energy than we could ever conceive of using from fossil fuels, today, in order to not only fix the problem, but to power the immensity of FUTUREWORLD itself. Every nation will have a space program thatï¿½s thousands of times larger than what the world has today, for example (and that requires a lot of clean energy). There will be some 20 billion people living mostly in futuristic 3d cities. Everything will be electrified and space solar power will have begun to replace the molten salt reactors for primary energy source. Molten salt reactors are required to replace fossil fuels. </font></span><br><br>
