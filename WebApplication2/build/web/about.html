<span style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:21px;"><font color="black">Quora is mission is to share and grow the worlds knowledge. A vast amount of the knowledge that would be valuable to many people is currently only available to a few either locked in peoples heads, or only accessible to select groups. We want to connect the people who have knowledge to the people who need it, to bring together people with different perspectives so they can understand each other better, and to empower everyone to share their knowledge for the benefit of the rest of the world.</font></span><br><br>

<span style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:30px;font-weight:bold;"><font color="black">Gather Around a Question</font></span><br><br>
<span style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:21px;"><font color="black">The heart of Quora is questions questions that affect the world, questions that explain recent world events, questions that guide important life decisions, and questions that provide insights into why other people think differently. Quora is a place where you can ask questions you care about and get answers that are amazing.</font></span><br><br>

<span style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:21px;"><font color="black">Quora has only one version of each question. It doesn�t have a left wing version, a right wing version, a western version, and an eastern version. Quora brings together people from different worlds to answer the same question, in the same place � and to learn from each other. We want Quora to be the place to voice your opinion because Quora is where the debate is happening. We want the Quora answer to be the definitive answer for everybody forever.</font></span><br><br>
