<span style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:30px;font-weight:bold;"><font color="black">Violent Riot Breaks Out At KIIT University, SRPF Deployed</font></span><br><br>
<span style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:20px;"><font color="black">Violent clashes broke out between the Law School and Engineering department of Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT), Bhubaneshwar on 24 November after simmering tensions over lewd comments passed to a female student the previous day.<br><br>

On the evening of 23 November, a second-year B-Tech Mechanical Engineering student allegedly harassed and teased a final year female law student. Following the incident, the law student and her batchmates protested at the BTech hostel and demanded an apology. The accused apologised by the end of the day.<br><br>

However, the next day, hundreds of engineering students reportedly entered the Law School with beer bottles, sticks, bats, stones and even knives with an intention to damage the school and cause harm to the students. According to Arguendo, a civilian activism platform, the incident continued for over an hour and even entered one of the hostels, where unaware law students were brutally assaulted.</font></span><br>
