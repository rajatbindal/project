<span style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:30px;font-weight:bold;"><font color="black">Why does Usain Bolt slow down at the finish line?</font></span><br><br>
<span style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:20px;"><font color="black">During trials, preliminaries, and sometimes semifinals/penultimates,
athletes that are above their competition don�t want to fully exert themselves.
The qualifying races are often consecutive, and they may have other events to do.<br>
That�s likely why Usain Bolt slows down in qualifying races, but he also slows down in finals, which is probably what you�re talking about.<br>
Some people think it�s just showboating. It would appear that way. At the recent summer Olympics, he decelerated before the finish line and smiled at the group of cameras.</font></span><br>

<span style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:30px;font-weight:bold;"><font color="black">Would you rather get punched in the face by Mike Tyson or by The Rock?</font></span><br><br>
<span style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:20px;"><font color="black">This one is pretty much a no-brainer, even if you take Mike Tyson now at about 52 years old, that doesn�t erase that his hands are registered as lethal weapons for a reason and all those years of JUST practicing how to punch someone out and Mike Tyson in his later parts of his career admitted he was out to seriously injure and maim someone with his fists.


Here he is, next to Wrestling Legend Chris Jericho a few years back, sure Jericho is not the biggest Superstar muscle wise, but he is certainly bigger than the average man and Iron Mike still makes Jericho look smaller, so he is keeping himself in shape despite his growing age.

<br>Now, Dwayne �The Rock� Johnson, Mega star for Hollywood and one of the top grossing actors of our time, constantly at the gym to keep himself pretty tight.


Looks very imposing yes? All that muscle and strength at his disposal, a person would be like �Please don�t hit me.� But his hands are not considered weapons and although he has a lot of strength at his fingertips, unlike Mike Tyson, he has not spent a portion of his life knowing how to punch other professionals out, The Rock at the height of his athletic career trained to showcase flashy moves that amaze the fans and get them riled up, like a modern day gladiator minus the death matches.

<br>Although I would most certainly not go looking to be decked by The Rock, but I have a less chance of dying by being punched by a man who would likely be throwing a street fighter level style punch over a man who spent his entire life aiming to maim someone with his fists and trained to put down monsters with only punches.</font></span><br><br>
