<span style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:30px;font-weight:bold;"><font color="black">What does Google's "I'm Feeling Lucky" feature do?</font></span><br><br>
<span style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:20px;"><font color="black">How to use it?<br>
Whenever you feel not to surf more type your search article and click I'm Feeling Lucky it will direct you to best result i.e highest ranked site. But this cost there revenue of as much as $110 million.


<br><br>1. They are Smart.<br>
Google just effectively offed one of it's oldest, quirkiest features � the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button.<br><br>
The good news is that in the process, Google added at least another hundred million dollars in revenue.<br><br>
It used to be that you could go to Google, type a search query into the search box and then, by clicking "I'm feeling lucky," go directly to the page that would have been listed as the top search result.
But then today happened, and Google announced "Google Instant." Now, when you go to Google and start typing a search into the search bar, Google instantly begins showing search results. Users no longer have a chance to click the "I'm Feeling Lucky Button" before they begin seeing search results. Yes, the button is still there on Google � but essentially, the feature is dead.<br>
So, how does killing the "I'm feeling lucky" button gain Google more than $100 million?
In 2007, Google search boss Marissa Mayer estimated that 1% of all Google searches go through the I'm Feeling Lucky button � skipping Google's search results pages entirely.</font></span><br>

Even as Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel are planning to close down the mobile connections of the subscribers with monthly spend below Rs 35 from their network, resulting in closure of more than 200 million 2G connections, there is not much to worry. While Vodafone subscribers can avail new five plans where the lowest recharge is Rs 35 a month, Bharti Airtel users can subscribe to new seven pan-India plan starting at Rs 35, to keep their 2G connections running.<br><br>
At present, while Bharti Airtel has about 100 million such users, Vodafone Idea hosts around 150 million subscribers.</font></span><br><br>
