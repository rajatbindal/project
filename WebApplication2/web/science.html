First, once the sun is extinguished, the temperature of the earth will eventually drop to somewhere around 10 degrees above absolute zero, give or take. Those who cannot protect themselves from the cold will die first. How fast the earth cools will vary dramatically.<br><br>
The surface of the earth isn�t going to get super cold immediately, but it will be fast. I would guess that somewhere around the third day it�s going to start to be uncomfortable for anyone without a good heat source. After a week the average earth temperature will be freezing. 0 deg Celsius, 32 deg Fahrenheit. It will vary tremendously depending on where you live.<br><br>
It will stay warmer longer near the oceans and get colder faster the farther you get from them and obviously what started out cold will just get colder. It will take 1�3 years for them to freeze over.<br><br>
We can get by for months this way, as the earth slowly cools, but after a year the average surface temperature of the earth will be -73 degrees Celsius, -100 Fahrenheit. An awful lot of people will run out of food and water well before then though.<br><br>

If someone lived near geothermal activity in a well insulated structure and managed to get both heat and electricity, (light) from it indefinitely and had a hydroponic farm, they could go on for 10 to 20 years before the oxygen started to get cold enough to turn to liquid and become rain made of oxygen, and then as it got progressively colder it would become snow.<br><br>

<span style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:20px;"><font color="black">In 1985, Doc Brown needed a plentiful source of plutonium to generate the 1.21 gigawatts needed to power his DeLorean time machine.<br>

After a quick trip the future, the Doc was able to upgrade his fuel source to an off-the-shelf, domestic Mr Fusion power generator, which could convert anything (even a banana skin) into a source of clean power. Of course, this was just science fiction.<br>

The goal of creating a real, stable nuclear fusion device capable of generating massive amounts of energy has been pursued by physicists for decades, starting in the early 1950s. Whilst we have subsequently created working nuclear fusion reactors, the reaction is often short-lived and requires more energy to establish than the device can actually produce - an energy deficit.<br><br>
However, recently, scientists at MIT have announced that they believe successful nuclear fusion will soon be achieved. Using new superconducting materials to produce ultra-powerful magnets and radical new reactor designs created by supercomputers, these scientists believe they will be able to supply clean, limitless energy into the grid within the next 10 to 15 years. That might sound a long way off, but think how fast we got from 2008 to 2018, and suddenly you

<span style="font-family:Helvetica;font-size:20px;"><font color="black">A spacecraft that cost nearly a billion dollars is on course to make a perilous landing Monday on Mars, if it can survive a high-speed approach and the scorching heat of entering the Red Planet�s atmosphere, a process Nasa has nicknamed �six-and-a-half minutes of terror�.<br><br>
�There is very little room for things to go wrong,� said Rob Grover, head of the entry, descent and landing team at Nasa�s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.<br><br>
If successful, the entry, descent and landing of the Mars InSight � designed to be the first mission to listen to the interior of another planet and reveal how rocky planets formed � will add another success to Nasa�s record when it comes to sending spacecraft to Mars.
<br><br>
So far the United States is the only nation to have made it there, and only Nasa�s unmanned Curiosity robotic rover is still tooling around on the surface. The space agency�s older, smaller Opportunity was roaming around up there until June, when a global dust storm knocked it out of service.
<br><br>
But if InSight fails, it certainly won�t be the first.
